📖 Overview
This project presents a real-time South African Sign Language (SASL) translation system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for gesture-to-text and speech translation.

The system captures hand gestures from a webcam, classifies them into corresponding SASL alphabet letters (A–Z), converts the output into text, and then generates speech. It is designed to improve accessibility and real-time communication between Deaf and hearing individuals.
